<h2>THE BUBBLE SHOP; OR, "ONLY HIS PLAY."</h2>

<p>How many deserving persons besides dramatic authors are looking
about for good situations, and are unable to find them! Mr. <span class="sc">'Enry
Hauthor Jones</span> was sufficiently fortunate to obtain a good dramatic
situation of tried strength, which, placed in the centre of novel and
most improbable (not to say impossible) surroundings, has, in the
hands of Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Wyndham</span> and his highly trained company
of illusionists, achieved a remarkable success.</p>

<p>Within the last few years there have been notorious cases
associated with the names of Members of Parliament, but as the
House is a Legislative Assembly and not an inquisitorial tribunal
instituted for the public investigation of private morality, no charge
could be brought in the House itself against any one of its Members
until after a Court of Law had pronounced its verdict, and, even
then, a Member of Parliament, convicted of a criminal offence,
would not cease <i>ipso facto</i> to belong to the House until after a motion
for his expulsion had been carried. As <i>Fritz</i> in <i>La Grande Duchesse</i>
expressed his wish to become a schoolmaster, in order that he might
obtain some smattering of education, so an immoral M.P. (if any
such there be) would be the very one to stand sponsor for a Bill for
the Better Preservation of Public Morals, with a view to gaining
that elementary knowledge of morality in which his education had
been defective. But no one could have brought up some awkward
case against him in the course of a debate in the House. In the parliamentary
proceedings of Little Peddlington this might be done, but
not in the House of Commons, which, by a very polite but necessary
fiction, is supposed to be a House of Uncommons, far above the
weaknesses of the ordinary human nature of mere Constituents.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:600px;"><a href="images/145.png"><img src="images/145-600.png" width="600" height="404" alt="Model Figures in the Criterion Toy-Shop." /></a><br /><br /><span class="sc">Model Figures in the Criterion Toy-Shop.</span></div>

<p><i>Mr. Stoach</i> (capitally played by Mr. <span class="sc">J. Valentine</span>&mdash;but everybody
plays capitally in this piece) finds <i>Lord Clivebrooke</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">Charles
Wyndham</span>&mdash;admirable also) between midnight and one in the morning
alone with charming <i>Jessie Keber</i> (Miss <span class="sc">Mary Moore</span>,&mdash;delightful!)
in old <i>Matthew Keber's</i> toy-shop, <i>Keber</i> himself (another very
clever impersonation by Mr. <span class="sc">W. H. Day</span>) having gone out on the sly
to get drunk on money supplied him by the aforesaid unscrupulous
<i>Stoach, M.P.</i> So what would have to be said in the House should
amount to this:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Stoach.</i> What! the Leader of the House bring in this Purity Bill!!
Why I saw him myself with my own eyes in a toy-shop, all among
the toys, alone at one in the morning with an attractive young person
of the female persuasion.</p>

<p>"Look at that now," says an Irish M.P., following the example
of <i>Shaun the Post</i> in <i>The Colleen Bawn</i>, when the scoundrelly
lawyer brings a charge against the hero of the drama, "An' what
might <i>you</i> be doin' about there at that same time?"</p>

<p>Supposing, for an instant, the impossible, <i>Stoach</i> would be called to
order, and be severely reprimanded by the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>.</p>

<p>Had the much-heckled and long-suffering <i>Clivebrooke</i> been gifted
by the Author with lively ready-wit, he would have replied to his
father and supporters, who invade his room, in the pleasantest
and Charliest-Wyndhamest manner, "Yes (<i>lightly and airily</i>).
What could I be doing in a toy-shop with a young lady? Why
(<i>still more lightly and airily</i>) of course I was '<i>toying with
her!</i>'"
Whereupon his old father would have been immensely tickled, and
the deputation, in fits of laughter, would have rushed back to the
lobby to report "the last good thing said by that clever chap
<i>Clivebrooke!</i>
So like him!"</p>

<p>This Act would have ended with the triumph of ready-wit over
disappointed malignity. <i>Jessie
Keber</i> would have run in and embraced her
hero, the Bill would have been carried (<i>Cheers heard without</i>),
and all would have ended happily and pleasantly without
any necessity having arisen for another Act, either of Parliament
or of the piece.</p>

<p>"Yes," says this dramatist, "I admit the soft impeachment. I
plead guilty, with extenuating circumstances. <i>The play's the
thing</i>; and if the facts don't suit my play, so much the worse for the
facts. Success has been achieved, and what more can any living
author want? Credit and cash. <i>Voil&agrave; tout!</i>
'Credit' for my own original
invention in hitting upon the Parliamentary accessories to my
picture; and 'cash,' which will be paid as long as the public take
an interest <i>in</i> the play, and just so long shall I take my interest
<i>out</i> of the public money."</p>

<p>To sum up in the words of the old-fashioned tag, "If our friends
in front are pleased, then Manager and Author are satisfied." But,
if objection be still taken to the unreality of the Parliamentary
setting of the picture, then "please remember," apologises <span class="sc">'Enry
Hauthor</span>, "that '<i>it's only my play</i>.'"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Walking Round His Subject.</span>&mdash;In <span class="sc">Tay Pay's</span> interesting review
of <i>The Life of Lord Aberdeen</i>, a Book of the Week in the <i>Sun</i>,
there is a delightful chord which shows that "the harp that once
thro' Tara's halls" still upon occasion twangs. "It is pleasant,"
says <span class="sc">Tay Pay</span>, writing of Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, "to be able to project
ourselves backward to the time, when the statesman we know as
full of years and the idol of millions, was the bashful, self-distrustful
youth." Now, if next week our young friend, whose
sympathy with bashful, self-distrustful youth, is instinctive, will
manage to withdraw himself forward, he may be said to have
thoroughly reconnoitered his subject, an excellent thing in a
reviewer.</p>

<h2>AT THE CONFECTIONER'S.</h2>

<h3>(<i>A Sketch on Saturday Afternoon.</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>.&mdash;<i>A Confectioner's Shop in a fashionable West-End
thoroughfare.
Close to the window is a counter, with the usual urns and
appurtenances, laden with an assortment of richly decorated
pastry, and presided over by an alert and short-tempered</i>
Manageress. <i>The little tables are close together, and crowded
with</i> Customers, <i>the majority of whom are ladies. A couple of
over-worked</i> Waitresses <i>are endeavouring, with but indifferent
success, to satisfy everybody at once.</i></p>

<p><i>Cries from Customers.</i> Yes, two teas and <i>one</i> roll and butter&mdash;no,
I mean, one roll and butter and <i>two</i> teas! "<i>Have I ordered?</i>"
Why, the last time you said it was coming directly! Isn't that
chocolate ready <i>yet?</i> We shall <i>never</i> catch our train! I say,
Waitress, I ordered coffee and cakes a quarter of an hour ago, and
all we've got yet is two empty cups and a bowl of sugar! <i>Do</i> make
haste with that tea! I didn't say a <i>cup</i> of
tea&mdash;I said a <i>pot</i> of tea, as plain as&mdash;&mdash;! (&amp;c., &amp;c.)</p>

<p><i>Duet of Waitresses.</i>
Yes, Sir, attend to you in one moment. Are <i>you</i> the cup of tea, Madam?
Oh, I'll bring you a fork for your pastry directly.
There'll be some milk coming in a minute, Sir. Bread and butter? No,
Sir, you can have a <i>roll</i> and butter, or cakes, if you prefer them. Excuse me,
Madam, when I've done attending to <i>this</i> lady. No, Sir; it was the other young lady who took
your order&mdash;not me. <i>Would</i> you mind letting me have the milk-jug, if you've finished with it,
Madam? We're rather short of them. I'll <i>see</i> if I can get you a teaspoon, Sir. (&amp;c., &amp;c.)</p>

<p><i>The Manageress</i> (<i>all in one breath, without any stops</i>).
Now then Miss <span class="sc">Simpson</span> don't you see these cups standing
here ready to be taken and there's that Gentleman in
the corner waiting to be attended to and tell Mrs. <span class="sc">Binks</span> we shall
want more milk and there put out those fancy cakes do two chocolates
Miss <span class="sc">Jones</span> well you can't have them yet because I've used
all the hot water what does the girl want next butter it's no use
coming <i>to me</i> for butter here take those cups to be washed up will
you you leave me to look after everythink myself and customers
leaving because they can't get served I declare I never saw such
girls as you are in all my born days!</p>

<p><i>A Man from the Lyceum.</i> I'm not sure, after all, that <span class="sc">Irving's</span>
finest moment wasn't in that last scene. I mean, when <i>Fitzurse</i>
and those fellows came in, and he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Lady</i> (<i>at adjoining table&mdash;from the Aquarium Theatre</i>).
Sat up on his <i>dear</i> tail, and struck out with those long hind legs of
his, <i>sweet</i> thing; he took such an <i>interest</i> in it all, didn't he?</p>

<p><i>Second Lady</i> (<i>on opposite side of table&mdash;who has been to
"Hypatia"</i>).
Oh, and didn't she look <i>distractingly</i> lovely just after she
had finished lecturing; <i>you</i> know, when she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Third L.</i> (<i>close by, fresh from "Charley's Aunt"</i>). Stepped out
of the gown, and walked about in the old Lady's cap and false
front! I quite <i>cried</i> with laughing!</p>

<p><i>Second L.</i> I liked the Proconsul&mdash;dear me, what <i>was</i> his name?
So <i>stupid</i> of me&mdash;but it doesn't matter! I thought he looked so perfectly
Byzantine when he came in with his lictors in the litter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Third L.</i> And played the piano so <i>beautifully!</i></p>

<p><i>Second Hypatian L.</i> And didn't you think <span class="sc">Tree</span> was very
good?&mdash;that
part where he found out about his daughter, and stood
towering over her with a knife in his hand, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Third L.</i> That enormous cigar stuck in his mouth&mdash;he was simply
too <i>killing!</i> [<i>And so on.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Camille Leon</i> (<i>by voiceless motion of her lips, and expressive
pantomime, for the guidance of her fianc&eacute;</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">Fred Forridge</span>,
<i>who
has gone to the counter to select dainties for her refection</i>). No, not
<i>those</i>&mdash;in the <i>next</i> dish&mdash;with chocolate outside ... no the
<i>long</i> ones&mdash;<i>oh</i>,
how stupid you are! Yes, if those are preserved cherries on
the iced sugar. Very well, the <i>pink</i> one, then&mdash;that will do.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forridge</i> (<i>returning with a loaded plate</i>). I hope I've got
what you wanted?</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> <i>Just</i> what I like&mdash;<i>how</i> clever of you! (<i>She
helps
herself, after dainty deliberation.</i>) Quite delicious! Aren't you
going to have any yourself?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>engaged in exploring his left-hand pocket surreptitiously,
with a
troubled expression</i>).
Oh, thanks&mdash;presently,
perhaps. (<i>To
himself.</i>) I must
have more than that
<i>somewhere!</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:500px;"><a href="images/148.png"><img src="images/148-500.png" width="500" height="450" alt="'I must have more than that _somewhere!_'" /></a><br />"I must have more than that <i>somewhere!</i>"</div>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> (<i>gaily</i>).
I advise you to make
haste&mdash;or there'll be
none left. They're
too seductive for
words. [<i>She chooses
another.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>to
himself</i>). It <i>is</i> one-and-sixpence.
Fool
I was to go and forget
my sovereign-purse!
However&mdash;(<i>hopefully</i>),
two cups
of tea at fourpence&mdash;eightpence;
say
three cakes at twopence&mdash;one-and-twopence&mdash;oh,
I shall
manage it easily,
and leave a margin!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I think I
won't have anything
to eat&mdash;not <i>hungry</i>,
don't you know.</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> No
more am <i>I!</i> (<i>She
takes a third cake.</i>)
This has got cream
inside&mdash;aren't you
tempted?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>to himself.</i>)
Only fourpence
to the good
now&mdash;mustn't risk
it! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Couldn't
indeed&mdash;spoil my
appetite for dinner.</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> (<i>with superiority</i>). Oh, I never <i>have</i> any
appetite for
dinner. I loathe the very sight of food, somehow! But I do <i>wish</i>
you'd eat something&mdash;it's so <i>piggish</i> of you not to&mdash;<i>really</i> it is!
You must take just this weeny little one&mdash;to please Me! (<i>She
places it on his plate.</i>) Now you <i>can't</i> say no!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She is the <i>dearest</i> darling!
(<i>Aloud.</i>)
I'd do anything in the world to please you, <span class="sc">Camille</span>! (<i>To
himself.</i>)
After all, there's still <i>twopence!</i></p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> Good boy! (<i>As he eats.</i>) Well, is it a success?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>munching</i>). It isn't bad&mdash;got Marchpane, or something
of the kind on it.</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> How nice! I adore Marchpane! You may go and
get me one just like it, if you're <i>very</i> good.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>to himself, as he obeys her behest</i>). That cleans me
out! Thank goodness, no gratuities are allowed here, or else&mdash;and
this <i>must</i> be the last&mdash;she's had three already! If I'd only had
another sixpence, I shouldn't care, but this is running it devilish
close! (<i>Aloud, as he returns.</i>) This is the nearest I could get.</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> Thanks, ever so much. Awfully nice tea this is.
(<i>Suggestively.</i>) They might give one bigger cups, though!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>to himself, with pathos</i>). I'd give my life for her,
cheerfully&mdash;and I've got to deny her a second cup of tea! But
hang it, I <i>must</i>. I can't ask her to lend me fourpence to pay the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>
bill! (<i>Aloud.</i>) It's&mdash;er&mdash;just as well they don't. My sisters have
sworn off afternoon tea altogether; some medical Johnny told them
it&mdash;er&mdash;had a tendency to make the nose red!</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). <span class="sc">Fred's</span> <i>sisters!</i> Very
likely! (<i>Aloud,
coldly.</i>) If you think there is any danger of that in <i>my</i> case, of
course I won't risk another cup.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> Oh&mdash;er&mdash;well, you never <i>know</i>, don't you know.
I&mdash;er&mdash;<i>wouldn't</i>.
(<i>To himself.</i>) Narrow shave that, by Jove!</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> I think we'd better take a cab back, don't you?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>horrified</i>). M&mdash;much jollier walking. Streets as dry
as a bone!</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> But I want to get home and arrange the table for
dinner to-night. Mother always likes me to do the flowers.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> Lots of time for that You c&mdash;can't judge of the effect
till it's dark, <i>can</i> you? And it
will be light for hours to come.</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> Yes, that's true.
Then suppose we go and see the
<span class="sc">Burne-Joneses</span>, now we're so
near? They don't close till six.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It
<i>would</i> have been jolly; but, half-a-crown,
when I can't even run
to a <i>catalogue!</i> No! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
It&mdash;it's getting so dark&mdash;can't
do 'em justice by artificial light,
do you think? And&mdash;well, to tell
you the honest truth, <span class="sc">Camille</span>,
after the Old Masters, you know&mdash;I&mdash;I
don't feel&mdash;and I <i>have</i> seen
them, you know!</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> (<i>pouting</i>). I thought
you might have cared to see
them again&mdash;with Me&mdash;but it
doesn't in the least matter ...
<span class="sc">Fred</span>, I don't care about this cake
you got me&mdash;it's dull. I think
I shall leave it, and try one of
these white-and-green ones
instead. [<i>She does.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>to himself&mdash;with a
beaded brow</i>). Broke! And for
an extra twopence! As likely as
not, she hasn't even got her purse
with her. And she'll think I'm
so beastly mean! Why on earth
didn't I let her go to the A&euml;rated
Bread-shop, as she wanted? It
would have been all right then!</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> I'm afraid you're
rather bored, <span class="sc">Fred</span>&mdash;you don't
seem to be enjoying yourself
quite; <i>do</i> you?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>in agony</i>). Oh, I
<i>am</i>&mdash;I'm all right, <span class="sc">Camille</span>,
only I&mdash;I'm always like this after
the Old Masters, you know.</p>

<p><i>Miss C. L.</i> So sorry I made
you bring me&mdash;don't you think
we had better pay, and go home?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Now
for it! (<i>He pulls himself together.</i>)
W&mdash;waitress, w&mdash;what have I to
pay, please?</p>

<p><i>Waitress.</i> Two teas, eightpence; one, two&mdash;<i>six</i> cakes you've had,
I think, Sir? One-and-eightpence altogether.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Forr.</i> (<i>with a gasp</i>). Oh! (<i>He fetches up two coins abjectly
from his pocket</i>). I&mdash;I'm sorry to say that I&mdash;I've o&mdash;only one
shilling and (<i>with a start of intense relief</i>) half-a-sovereign, so
(<i>with
recovered dignity</i>) I'm afraid I must ask you to give me change.
(<i>To</i> Miss C. L.) I&mdash;I was only joking about the <span class="sc">Burne-Joneses</span>,
darling, I'd like to see them <i>awfully</i>&mdash;with you. And we can
walk home through the Park, or take a cab afterwards, just as <i>you</i>
feel about it. <i>Do</i> say you'll come!</p>

<p>[Miss <span class="sc">Leon</span> <i>graciously consents, and</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Forridge</span>

<h2>ROBERT AT THE BOAT-RACE.</h2>


<p>Well, as I've often said afore, and shall most probberly live to
say it again, there ain't no acounting for taste, speshally among the
hupper classes. Take last Wensday as a xampel. Here's a lot of
about twenty of the most heminent Swells in our most heminent
Huniwersitys, where they goes, as we all on us knows, to learn how
to tork Greek, which they finds so wunderful useful when they
growes up. Well, they has the hole year to choose from, save and
xcept Sundays, and I'm jiggered, as I herd a real Gent say, if they
don't go and select a day as goes and begins with a hawful heasterly
wind, and a contemptible shower of rain, just enuff to make thowsands
of our most loveliest Ladys at wunce risolve not to wenter out ewen to
see such a site as two boats full of hansum young gennelmen, all
drestin flannel, a pulling of them
two boats a matter of four miles!
And yet I'm told as there's a
learned Gent as publishes a little
book as tells you what the whether
will be ewery day in the year, and
he's werry offen rite.</p>

<p>However, it all turned out rite
at larst, and we had a nice sunny
day, tho' why they kep us all a
waiting till arf-past fore o'clock
I'm sure I don't kno, when there
was thowsends of us waiting afore
two. Another little misstery is,
why they want no less than hayteen
strong-looking gents to pull too
little Botes along, sixteen on 'em a
pulling with their skulls, and two
on 'em a pulling with too little
ropes apeace, I have never bin
able to make out.</p>

<p>I was told as it was a lovely
race, tho it seemed werry much as
usual to me. One of the botes got
a little in front of the other, and
so got in fust, and that was all.
But, sumhow, I don't quite think
as that is all as so many thowsands
goes out for. For instance,
now, in the butiful ship as I was
perfeshnally engaged in, we laid
out a lovely lunshun with evry
luckshury of the season, and all
kinds of wine, at about 2 o'clock,
and then, as we picked up our
swell passengers at the warious
peers, our Managing Gent says to
them, says he, "If you please,
Gents, lunch is laid out in the
cabin, and will be continually laid
out all day, so you can act accordin."
And so they did! and that
cabin was jest about comfertably
occepied all day long, except for
about ten minutes jest as the
Botes was a cummin by. Ah!
that's my highdeal of spending
an appy day, and a pitty
it is as it ony comes wunce a
year!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brown</span>, who was along with me, tried werry Hard to gammon me
to bleeve as none of the pullers in the fust boat got nothink for
winning, and that none of the pullers in the larst boat paid nothink
for loosing! But I wasn't quite such a born fool as to beleeve that
rubbish. I had jest the same good larf as usual in seeing how hard
the three big steam-boats, as started jest after the racing-boats, tried
their werry hardest to catch 'em up, but coudn't do it till they was
past the winning post! And the best of the fun was, as they painted
two of 'em Oxford and Cambridge, to make all poor greenhorns
beleeve as they was the reel racing-boats, and the other was a going
fust jest to show 'em the way. Lor, how heasy it is to gammon sum
poor fellers! Like all trew waiters, hating any think at all like
waste, me and <span class="sc">Brown</span>, and the other two of us, seed all our Company
hoff, and then we quietly took our seats, and I bleeves as I can
truly say, that, neether in the eatable line, or the drinkable line,
was there any waste in that there bootiful Steamer that there appy
day.</p>

<h2>A DELICATE QUESTION.</h2>

<p class="center">[In the pages of the <i>Author</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Besant</span> suggests, that "the
Society of
Authors should undertake the examination of journalists."]</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>O zealous Mr. <span class="sc">Besant</span>, we have heard with consternation</p>
<p class="i2">Of this, the latest project of your ever-busy band;</p>
<p>Each journalist, apparently, must pass examination,</p>
<p class="i2">Lest any deal with matters which he does not understand.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>You're horrified to notice at performances dramatic</p>
<p class="i2">A row of so-called critics, knowing nothing of the play;</p>
<p>You mean to make essential an acquaintance with the Attic,</p>
<p class="i2">In all allowed to comment on the drama of to-day.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>With ample stock of history and other knowledge, clearly,</p>
<p class="i2">The man who writes on politics must show himself supplied,</p>
<p>The taste of all reviewers will be criticised severely,</p>
<p class="i2">The Sporting Sage must qualify in papers on <i>Ruff's Guide</i>.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>No doubt your plan is laudable, but then we find it printed</p>
<p class="i2">That novelists to manage all the scheme will be allowed,</p>
<p>And since they love reviewers not, it may, perhaps, be hinted,</p>
<p class="i2">That every man alive of us is certain to be ploughed!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Moreover, on reflection, quite excusably one fancies</p>
<p class="i2">That, if so great advantage in the system you discern,</p>
<p>Its use should be extended to the weavers of romances,</p>
<p class="i2">And you and other novelists should suffer in your turn!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And so, if we may venture on a practical suggestion,</p>
<p class="i2">Assuming that your postulate's indubitably true,</p>
<p>And all should be examined&mdash;there must yet remain the question,</p>
<p class="i2"><i>Custodes quis custodiet?</i>&mdash;For who'll examine <i>you?</i></p>

Why, 'tis evident that such a case would not arise, as professional

<h2>EASTER REGULATIONS FOR VOLUNTEERS.</h2>

<p>1. Volunteers shall be expected to be up
by the dawn in the morning, be the weather
rain or shine, fog, or otherwise. They will
be marched for scores of miles all day long,
and, on their arrival at their destination,
shall consider themselves lucky if they find
the most primitive accommodation.</p>

<p>2. Although they may be accompanied by
their officers, the Volunteer rank and file
will clearly understand that they are man&oelig;uvring
purely for the pleasure, if not
improvement, of a few warriors connected
with the Household troops.</p>

<p>3. They shall undertake the necessary
duties at their own expense, and every detail
supplied by the War Office shall form the
matter of an angry altercation.</p>

<p>4. The convenience of Volunteers shall be
ignored, so that the comforts of the Regular
officers attached to the Citizen Force, may be
secured at their expense.</p>

<p>5. Volunteer officers will be prepared to
accept snubs and condescension with their
customary humility, and will not presume to
raise their voices in the presence of their superior
(in quality if not in rank) commanders.</p>

<p>6. Volunteers of all ranks will work like
niggers for nothing, save the barren honour of
being told (subsequently in the public prints)
that they have merely done their duty.</p>

<p>7. And, to conclude, Volunteers will be
expected to say that they have thoroughly
enjoyed their holiday, however difficult it
may be to feel it.</p>

<h2>QUITE A CHIC CARGO!</h2>

<p>A <span class="sc">GROUP</span> of "World's Women"
belonging to all races,
has set out from Southampton
in the steamship <i>Paris</i>, <i>en
route</i> to the World's Fair.
There are English damsels,
Scotch lassies, Tyrolese, Hungarian,
Parisian, Chinese, and
Japanese ladies. Instead of
being called "World's Women,"
they ought, of course,
to go as "World's Fair-ies."
"Arrangements have been
made for bringing them back;"
but suppose they prefer to
stay? America is a free country;
Chicago is one of the
freest parts of it. So, after
their relative powers of fascinating
the American male
have been tested, their power
of becoming his relatives may
have to be counted with. Let
us hope they will be accommodated
with separate buildings
at the Exposition; or a "Lady's
Battle" may ensue, under
Queensberry Rules. European
<i>versus</i> Asiatic, or&mdash;say&mdash;Fr&auml;ulein

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 20.</i>&mdash;"That's the best
speech <span class="sc">Harcourt</span> has made this Session," said <span class="sc">George Curzon</span>, as
we walked into Lobby to support Government against onslaught of
<span class="sc">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span>, who disapproves its Uganda policy.</p>

<p>"Which speech?" I asked, eagerly, always anxious to learn.
<span class="sc">George Curzon</span> just back from far East; has sat astride the Wall
of China, and taken five-o'clock tea with the <span class="sc">Queen of Corea</span>.
<span class="sc">Ulysses</span>, with his twenty-years' tramp, not in it with him. "Which
speech?" I repeated. "The speech he didn't make just now in
reply to <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>," said <span class="sc">Curzon</span>, in that sententious tone,
and
with that grave manner he has learned among the Apaches of the
Ural Mountains.</p>

<p>Wants thinking over, this; but is quite true. A great temptation
for the <span class="sc">Squire</span>; would have been irresistible at one time.
<span class="sc">Joseph</span> had
made a brilliant speech, scintillating with diamond dagger-points.
Yielding to the habit of heredity, he had been more than usually
disagreeable towards his Brethren. "The original <span class="sc">Joseph</span>," as the
<span class="sc">Squire</span> remarked, in a little aside, whilst the speech went on amid
uproarious delight of the Gentlemen of England, "had one soft place
in his resentful heart. But our <span class="sc">Joe</span> finds no <span class="sc">Benjamin</span> among
us&mdash;unless,
indeed, it be <span class="sc">Trevelyan</span>, and, I believe, if, after filling up
his sack, he had put in any extraneous substance, it would not
have been a cup of silver."</p>

<p>Time was when the <span class="sc">Squire</span> would have jumped at this opportunity.
Benches crowded with jubilant gentlemen in dinner dress; excitement
of cheers and counter-cheers filled House. Few things
delight it more than encounter between these two brilliant swordsmen.
Only half-past eleven; Twelve-o'clock Rule suspended; plenty
of time for business by-and-by; half an hour's sport hurt nobody.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:410px;"><a href="images/156a.png"><img src="images/156a-403.png" width="403" height="450" alt="Mr. G. (sings sotto voco), 'How happy could I be'" /></a>
<p><i>Mr. G.</i> (<i>sings sotto voco</i>), "How happy could I be
with either!<br />
<span style="float: right; margin-right: 6em;">Were only Uganda away!"</span></p></div>

<p>When <span class="sc">Squire</span> rose, a ringing cheer went up from Ministerialists.
Their turn now. <span class="sc">Joe</span> was "going to catch it." But <span class="sc">Squire</span> knew
better than that. Opportunity tempting; almost irresistible. But
business first, pleasure after. With touching air of resignation,
<span class="sc">Squire</span> said they had listened to a very good speech, and now he
hoped the Vote would be agreed to; at which point he meekly sat
down. Shock so sudden and unexpected that no one but <span class="sc">Nolan</span>
moved, and he, finding himself on his legs, had no words ready.
Whilst he was gasping in search of them, Closure moved; Chairman,
who is getting well into the saddle, put question with lightning-like
rapidity; before Committee quite knew where it was, it was dividing
on the Uganda Vote.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Supplementary Estimates concluded; Report of
Supply agreed to; way cleared for Appropriation Bill.</p>


<p><i>Tuesday Night.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Henry Fowler</span> explained Parish Council Bill
in speech of equal force and lucidity. "Hands all round," as
<span class="sc">Tennyson</span> said, in applause of speech and approval of Bill. <span class="sc">Jesse
Collings</span> rather hinted that anything good in measure was conveyed
from <span class="sc">Ritchie's</span> Bill, and everyone knows that <span class="sc">Ritchie</span> was mere
lay-figure behind which <span class="sc">Jesse</span> controlled policy of Local Government
Board under last Administration. Even this criticism meant
as compliment. No harsher note disturbed chorus of approval.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jokim</span>, in effusion of moment, led into making interesting confession.
As he says, only he put it stronger, general impression is
that he is not particularly attached to Agricultural Labourer. <span class="sc">Bobby
Spencer</span>, when he made his historic declaration&mdash;"Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>,
Sir, I am not an Agricultural Labourer"&mdash;understood to have
<span class="sc">Jokim</span> in his mind; endeavouring to ingratiate himself with the
statesman who, at the time, was <span class="sc">Chancellor of Exchequer</span>.
<span class="sc">Jokim</span>, certainly, through long and honourable career, never lost
opportunity of hustling <span class="sc">Hodge</span>. Deductions drawn from this attitude
entirely erroneous. Only been dissembling his love. Made
clean breast of it to-day. Clasping his hands with genuine emotion,
tear plainly tickling through his voice, he exclaimed, "It has been
the dream of my life to educate
the Agricultural Labourer in
Parish affairs!"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span>

<p>"Well, I must say, I never would
have thought it," said <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>,
regarding with new interest his
Right Hon. friend.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Parish Councils
Bill brought in.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Pretty to watch Mr.
G. in conversation with Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>
on question of Vote of Censure.
When <span class="sc">Cameron</span>, "doing a bit
of bounce," as <span class="sc">Brodrick</span> said, asked
<span class="sc">Premier</span> whether, supposing Opposition
resolved to move Vote of
Censure, a day wouldn't be found
for them, Ministerialists cheered and
Opposition responded. House never
more like public school than when a
fight is being got up. Now spirit
rose to bubbling point; cheering and
counter-cheering incessant. Only
Mr. G. sat silent, apparently so
deeply interested in Orders that he
had not noticed what was forward.
But he saw it all, saw a foot or two
further into futurity than the jubilant
throng behind him. <span class="sc">Cameron</span>
had unwittingly dealt trump card
to Opposition avowedly bent on obstructing
Home-Rule Bill. Had a
pretty good go to-day. Two hours
for Questions; two hours more to be
used up on Motion for Adjournment.
That would serve to throw Registration
Bill over sitting and spoil Mr.
G.'s little programme. But this suggestion of Vote of Censure
coming from other side, worth at least couple of days. Mr. G. saw
it all, and once glanced quickly across table in search of sign that
anyone on Front Bench opposite had made the discovery. Thought
he saw a gleam of intelligence in <span class="sc">Grandolph's</span> eye. Hoped things
might blow over; but there was inconvenient questioner behind, with
Scotch persistency waiting answer. Ministerialists cheering like
mad; Opposition truculently responding; all waiting for him.
Must do or say something. Wouldn't commit himself by saying
anything. Half rose from seat and bowed assent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:600px;"><a href="images/156b.png"><img src="images/156b-600.png" width="600" height="259" alt="POPPING THE QUESTIONS;" /></a><h3>POPPING THE QUESTIONS;</h3>

<h4><i>Or, Scene from old Burlesque of "Obstruction" as revived at St. Stephen's
Theatre Royal.</i></h4></div>

<p>By this time Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> began to see light. Some smart
fencing followed; Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> pressed home Vote of Censure
question; Mr. G., whilst carefully avoiding any movement that
might seem like retreat, evaded the point. Later, when <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>
remarked that <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> had challenged them to move Vote
of Censure, Mr. G. angrily retorted, "I did nothing of the sort."
Too late now; Right Hon. Gentlemen on Front Opposition Bench
having put their heads together, determined to ride in at gate
<span class="sc">Cameron</span> obligingly opened. Drew
up Motion of Vote of Censure, and
Mr. G. must needs, out of his diminishing
hoard of days, find one for
debating it; Opposition mean to
make it two, or even three.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Mr. G., in those
chest-notes that indicate profounder
indignation, "my people would
leave me to manage the business of
House."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Four hours
wasted. Vote of Censure invited.</p>

<p><i>Friday Midnight.</i>&mdash;Wonder to
find <span class="sc">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span>
still at post of duty. Business
rather heavy work; think it would
be well that so precious a life should
be cared for. Say this to him.</p>

<p>"You're very kind, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," he
answered, just a little wearily
"but I never think of myself when
the interests of my <span class="sc">Queen</span> and
Country are at stake. Fact is, I
have charge of a Bill drafted in
the interests of our fellow-citizen
the Sweep. He has thrown himself
into my arms (of course I use
the phrase in a Parliamentary
sense) and I am resolved to do my
best for him. I am told that the
business which called the Judges
into private consultation the other
day was a proposal to place my
bust, crowned with laurel, on a
prominent pedestal in the Royal
Courts of Justice. Well, I have
done something in my time for justice; just now all my sympathies
are with the Sweep. I receive deputations of them every day. No,
they don't enter by the chimney, but come in by the front-door in
ordinary fashion. When there are more than five of them, and they
stay over twenty minutes, they leave a little smell lingering in the
room. But that's nothing. I'm waiting now to move Second
Reading of my Bill. Want Mr. G. to take it up. Have told him
people really don't care for Home-Rule Bill, whereas, if he gave his
mind to it, he might rouse the country on the question of the
harmless necessary Sweep. But no use. He's too deeply rooted
in his attachment to his Home-Rule scheme. Daresay I shall get
my Bill through first."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Patience of long-suffering <span class="sc">Speaker</span> breaks down
at last. <span class="sc">Jemmy Lowther</span> did it. On Appropriation Bill moved
incomprehensible Amendment, in unintelligble speech; <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
came down on him "like cartload of bricks," as <span class="sc">John Burns</span> put it.
<span class="sc">James</span> only temporarily subdued; will probably come up smiling
on Monday.</p>
